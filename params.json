Useful while setting up since it gives detailed error messages. Don't forget to change to `false` after deploy.\r\n\r\n* `theme` - Theme to use for rendering. Choose one of: `default`, `application` and `agency`.\r\n\r\n* `mailchimp.apikey` - Enable MailChimp integration to your landing page by providing a [API key](http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/management/about-api-keys).\r\n\r\n* `mailchimp.list.id` - Each MailChimp list have a unique ID.

You are free to change any css, javascript or image. In `index.html` there are some rules you need to follow in order to keep Freelander functionality:\r\n\r\n* Keep form with `action=\"{{ path('subscribe') }}\" method=\"POST\"` in order to keep email subscription functionality. This form must contain email field.\r\n\r\n* Keep `{% include 'analytics.html.twig' %}` in order to keep Google Analytics trackng code rendered at the bottom of the page.\r\n\r\n* Keep `{% include 'flash.html.twig' %}` in order to render flash messages Freelander provides. If you want to customize this part, you can replace it with content of `views/flash.html.twig` and continue tweaking.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
